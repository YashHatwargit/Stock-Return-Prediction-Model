# Predicting Stock Return using CAPM and Fama French

## Details:

This project was offered by Finance and Analytics Club, IIT Kanpur during summers from May'22 to Jul'22. The following objective was archieved during the project:
- Implemented the CAPM model using Python and its libraries and estimated the price of stocks with an accuracy of 92%
- Analysed and compared various models based on their underlying factors, i.e., technical, fundamental, or macroeconomic
- Quantified risk & rewards by plotting Efficient Frontier Graph to obtain optimal weight for a portfolio with max. Sharpe ratio

## Week 1:    
Looked into basics syntax of Python, and libraries like pandas, scipy, matplotlib, datetime and pandas_datareader.

## Week 2:
Learnt about theory around CAPM model, security market line, Basics statistics (Linear Regression, R-squared, P-Value), Excess return and terminologies like Sharpe Ratio, beta, apha.

## Week 3:
Implemented the theory using Python and its libraries. Exported 1 year data of Bajaj Finance Ltd. from 1-Jan'21 to 1-Jan'22 and predicted its current price based on this trend.

## Week 4:
Read about Sharpe Ration in brief, and how to calculate it. Then, using Excel found out the maximum value of Sharpe Ratio from a portfolio consisting of 2 stocks.

## Week 5:
Started with Fama French Model. Read about different paramenter used in its calculations, like High minus Low (HML), Small minus Big (SMB), alpha and Efficient Market Hypothesis.

## Week 6:
Did extended reading of other factor models like, Carhart 4 factor model, Fung Hsieh 7 factor Model, Statistical Factor Model, Macroeconomic Factor Model, etc. based uses factors like momentum, liquidity, volatility, time to improve the accuracy of return predictions.
