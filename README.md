# Predicting Stock Return using CAPM and Fama French

## Details:

This project was offered by Finance and Analytics Club, IIT Kanpur during summers from May'22 to Jul'22. The following objective was archieved during the project:
- Implemented the CAPM model using Python and its libraries and estimated the price of stocks with an accuracy of 92%
- Analysed and compared various models based on their underlying factors, i.e., technical, fundamental, or macroeconomic
- Quantified risk and rewards by plotting the Efficient Frontier Graph to determine the optimal portfolio weight with the maximum Sharpe ratio

## Week 1:    
Explored basic Python syntax and libraries, including Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Datetime, and Pandas DataReader.

## Week 2:
Studied the theory behind the CAPM model, the Security Market Line, and basic statistics (Linear Regression, R-squared, P-Value). Familiarized with terms like Sharpe Ratio, beta, and alpha.
## Week 3:
Applied the theory using Python and its libraries. Exported one year of data for Bajaj Finance Ltd. (from 1-Jan'21 to 1-Jan'22) and predicted its current price based on this data.
## Week 4:
Reviewed the Sharpe Ratio and its calculation. Used Excel to determine the maximum Sharpe Ratio value from a portfolio of two stocks.

## Week 5:
Started working with the Fama-French Model, studying various parameters such as High minus Low (HML), Small minus Big (SMB), alpha, and the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
## Week 6:
Extended research to other factor models, including the Carhart 4-factor model, Fung-Hsieh 7-factor model, Statistical Factor Model, and Macroeconomic Factor Model. Investigated factors like momentum, liquidity, and volatility to enhance return prediction accuracy.
